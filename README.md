LIRI - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

### Objective
Create a node command line app that takes in certain commands, returning the data (Tweets, a Spotify Song and Movie Information) in a readable format. Additionally, once that data is generated, it is placed into the log.txt file, with the appropriate Date and Time it was created at.

### Commands
*  `my-tweets`

Displays 20 tweets from the username provided.
 
*  `spotify-this-song`

In order for this command to work, the user must provide a song name after typing in 'spotify-this-song'. They are able to do so by putting in it quotes, such as "

*  `movie-this`

 Similar to the command above, the user must provide the name of a movie when using this command. Example: "Ready Player One"

*  `do-what-it-says`

Upon running this command, the random.txt file is read, which contains the command 'spotify-this-song' for "I Want It That Way".
